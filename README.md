# MOSSE tracker

This project involves the development of a multi-channel MOSSE tracker for object tracking in videos. Initially designed for greyscale sequences, the tracker was upgraded to process RGB sequences. It was then tested with various features, including HOG and color names, to improve accuracy. The final enhancement incorporated deep learning by using features extracted from a ResNet, which was assessed to optimize performance.
